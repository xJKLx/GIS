# GIS Analysis in Building Resilient Settlements

This project in building resilient settlements explores aquaculture as a nature-based solution in the adaptation of coastal social-ecological systems to climate change. Aquaculture practices in seaweed and shellfish farming can realise potential benefits to ecosystem services including carbon sequestration and nitrogen bio-extraction and nutrient regulation, as well as mitigating eutrophication from agriculture. 

A GIS site analysis integrates environmental and socio-economic factors to assess site suitability in the  local context. Coastal resilience is achieved by aligning aquaculture initiatives with objectives for coastal protection. Aquaculture is an effective NbS coastal defense strategy providing enhanced protection in combination with submerged aquatic vegetation and living shorelines.

Coastkit by the Victoria State Government Environment, Land, Water and Planning Department (DELWP) was used to identify coastal hazard assessment levels. Tbe Werribee South Coast is exposed to medium to high erosion hazards, and very high levels in small sections.

The Werribee South coast off the Intensive Agricultural Precinct is exposed to high levels of Sea Level Rise under the very high inundation scenario in 2150, using data sourced from coastalrisk.com.au.

Water quality in the proximity of the Western Treatment Plant (WTP) is an important consideration for ensuring food safety of aquaculture products. The proposal factors this into consideration by applying an exclusion zone to waters suitable for human consumption of aquatic foods, regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Shellfish aquaculture aligns with objectives to improve water quality through nutrient regulation, mitigating the nutrient-rich runoff from the IAP.

There are synergies in aligning aquaculture initiative with biodiversity conservation objectives. In addition to nutrient reduction, shellfish are shown to contribute to well-functioning and resilient marine ecosystems. Naturekit by DELWP was used to identify biodiversity values of agriculture land, surrounding land uses and conservation areas.

Coastkit provided marine conservation sites and threatened species protected under state and national legislation.

This planning solution proposes aquaculture investigation areas off the coast of Werribee South from GIS analysis in relation to surrounding land use, coastal erosion hazards and conservation areas. The recommendation to establish aquaculture of oyster and seaweed aims to derive potential benefits in managing conservation and coastal protection, food security and provide a sustainable source of economic activities.
